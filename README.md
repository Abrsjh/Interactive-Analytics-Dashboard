# Interactive Analytics Dashboard

A sophisticated React-based analytics dashboard with advanced data visualization, real-time updates, and a responsive design. Built with TypeScript for type safety and performance optimization.


## Features

- **Multi-page dashboard** with React Router navigation
- **Advanced visualizations** using Recharts and D3.js
- **Interactive filtering system** with date ranges and multi-select dropdowns
- **Real-time data updates** with configurable refresh intervals
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Dark/light mode support** with persistent preferences
- **Performance optimized** with code splitting and virtualization
- **Comprehensive state management** using Context API and React Query

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   ├── charts/      # Chart components using Recharts
│   ├── layouts/     # Layout components like MainLayout
│   └── tables/      # Table components with advanced features
├── context/         # Global state management using Context API
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks 
├── pages/           # Page components for different dashboard views
├── services/        # API and data services
├── styles/          # Global styles and theming
└── utils/           # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Modular Component Structure**: Each visualization is a self-contained component with its own data fetching logic and state.
2. **Context API for Global State**: Application-wide state is managed using React Context with reducers for complex state logic.
3. **Custom Hooks for Data Fetching**: Dedicated hooks for data fetching with loading states, error handling, and automatic retries.
4. **Middleware for API Requests**: Axios interceptors for authentication, error handling, and request/response transformation.
5. **Scalable State Structure**: Separation of UI state, server state, and form state for better maintainability.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/analytics-dashboard.git
   cd analytics-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

## Component Structure

### Visualization Components

- **LineChartComponent**: Time-series visualization with zoom and pan capabilities
- **BarChartComponent**: Comparative data visualization with drill-down functionality
- **PieChartComponent**: Proportional data visualization with animations
- **MapComponent**: Geographic data visualization with interactive regions
- **DataTable**: Advanced data table with sorting, filtering, and virtualization

### Layout Components

- **MainLayout**: Main application layout with responsive sidebar and header
- **ChartWrapper**: Wrapper for all chart components with consistent styling and functionality

### Page Components

- **Dashboard**: Overview of key metrics with multiple visualization types
- **SalesAnalytics**: Detailed sales performance analysis with time comparisons
- **GeographicData**: Regional performance visualization with drill-down capability
- **Transactions**: Detailed transaction records with advanced filtering
- **Predictions**: Sales forecasting using regression models
- **Settings**: User preferences and dashboard customization

## Data Flow

1. **Data Fetching**: 
   - API requests are made through the API service layer with axios
   - Custom hooks manage loading states, error handling, and caching
   - Mock data is used for development with realistic patterns and trends

2. **State Management**:
   - Global state is managed using Context API with reducers
   - UI state (filters, layouts) is managed in component state or context
   - Form state is managed using controlled components
   - Server state is cached and managed using custom hooks

3. **Rendering Pipeline**:
   - Data is transformed and normalized before rendering
   - Charts are rendered using Recharts with customized themes
   - Components use React.memo and useMemo for performance optimization

## Extension Points

The dashboard is designed to be easily extended:

### Adding a New Chart Type

1. Create a new component in `src/components/charts/`
2. Use the ChartWrapper component for consistent styling
3. Import and use the component in any page component

### Adding a New Data Source

1. Add the API endpoint in `src/services/api.ts`
2. Create a custom hook in `src/hooks/` to fetch and transform the data
3. Use the hook in your components

### Adding a New Dashboard Page

1. Create a new page component in `src/pages/`
2. Add the route in `src/App.tsx`
3. Add the navigation item in `src/components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`

## Performance Considerations

- **Code Splitting**: React.lazy and Suspense for route-based code splitting
- **Memoization**: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for expensive calculations
- **Virtualization**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets in tables
- **Optimized Builds**: Production builds with tree shaking and code minification
